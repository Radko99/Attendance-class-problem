# Introduction - Attendance class problem

I'd like to introduce you to my first real problem/summary about solving problem as a beginner apprentince in Data Science field.
I hope you will enjoy it, also im widely open for any critical tips about my project.

The problem is about fitness club chain in Canada. Some classes are always fully booked. Fully booked classes often have a low attendance rate. The fitness club wants to increase the number of spaces available for classes. 
In this case im going to solve this problem.
